These are the steps for downloading and using TensorRT from a TAR package. The .deb package didn't work for me because it was missing the ONNX parser.

1. Go to the following page (NVIDIA forces you to make an account in order to download):
https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt/download/10x

2. Download the following .deb package:
TensorRT 10.5 GA for Linux x86_64 and CUDA 12.0 to 12.6 TAR Package

3. Get the TensorRT folder out of the tar and move it to /usr/local
sudo mv TensorRT-10.5.0.18 /usr/local/tensorrt-10.5

4. build_linux.sh should now work (assuming CUDA is installed). The /usr/local/tensorrt folder needs to be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running. The .onnx file needs to be in the same directory as the program.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/tensorrt-10.5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./inference
